		<p>Hello! I'm Léo Abel Serriere! </p> 
		<p>Lots of my time is spent making artwork, most of that artwork goes into books. Books that I print and then sell. They are not meant to be read in any particular order but I find they are at their best when they are sitting together. </p> 
		<p>Before this, when I was attending college, I was already making books. But they weren't like the ones I make now. They were attempts, ideas, completed thoughts open to more. Now my work is much more focused. I'm solely interested in kindness-based storytelling - as broadly as you can think it, I want to make work about it. </p> 
		<p>That's the kind of books I make now. They tell stories of humans, and nonhumans alike, working through intricacies like rolling tides and hurdles like tightrope-walks. The fact that they are comics is central to that theme. The stories I write have a technical need to be comic books. The way they are told work that way. </p> 
		<p>I didn't always want to tell stories making comic books. I spent years making videos that looped into one another, I used lithography for its endless production potential, I always drew - in an attempt to find ways to draw more. All this making required serious structure, kinds of structures that I am constantly improving on. Constantly making requires constant assessment - the warm, brimming, kind. Learning from our past attempts makes us stronger at what we do, especially if we don't look at them as failures. </p> 
		<p>The best way to end this is that I'm really looking forward to helping your kid make sense of the world around them. To allow them room to produce. To lend my experience on their path towards considerate, thoughtful, and driven, art .. </p>
