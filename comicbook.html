		<h1>Comic Book: <br> From Your Mind to the Printing Press</h1>
	</header>
	
	<main>
		
		<h3>For 8th Graders and High School students.<br>A 12 weeks class.</h3>
			<br>
		<h2>Where I'm Coming From</h2>
			<br>
		<p>What's wonderful about comic books is that while it takes serious effort and dedication, it’s also available for anyone of any age, any skill level, and all walks to life, to make and print their own books, telling stories only they know how to tell! </p>
		<p>That’s why I’m teaching this class. If you have a child who loves to read comics and shows serious interest in drawing them, or perhaps has already tried to a few times and can’t stop trying, or even that they want to keep learning and improving their art or writing skills because they’re sure it’s what they want to do in life, then this is the right course for them. </p>	
		<p>My main interest in this course is to be able to get your kid to go from the seed of an idea to a full ready-to-be-printed comic in 12 weeks! </p>
		
			<br>
		<h2>The <i>Secret</i> Secret</h2>
			<br>
		<p>I’m going to give away the secret of this course, because it’s really nothing to hide. It’s taken me a while to get there but more than any practice, or any amount of research, or any amount of ‘bright’ ideas, <b> the only way anyone has ever gotten to make a comic is to actually finish making it! </b> </p>
		<p>This course is all about giving you a set amount of time, and in that time being realistic with what we can make. That way, after this course, you’ll have a true understanding of the full process and a genuine idea of how to go about making the next one.</p>
		
			<br>
		<h2>How Many Pages Should You Expect To Have Done ..</h2>
			<br>
		<p>I've set for this class a <b>definite 25 page maximum</b>! It may not seem like a lot but as we'll see, it's plenty - and more isn't always better.</p>
		<p>In my own work I always look at the time I have available and go from there. Anyone serious about this industry and seriously invested in it practices this as well. </p>
	
			<br>
		<h2>How You'll Be Able To Make Your Own Comic - <br> a tentative curriculum</h2>
			<br>
		
		<h3>WEEK 1-2</h3>
		<p>Look together at what it takes to get a comic from the early stages all the way to the finish line. <br>Get into what you want to make, look at your favorite books, I’ll bring in some recommendations, and we’ll take some time to brainstorm what is possible to do in this given amount of time. </p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>WEEK 3</h3>
		<p>Quickly narrow down potential story ideas. Build out a narrative tree and an arch for your chosen story. </p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>WEEK 4</h3>
		<p>Outing to Desert Island Comics in Williamsburg to look at what artists can make. Or in-depth look at your story using other published works to learn from.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>WEEK 5</h3>
		<p>Practice with a few “test” pages to confirm this is what you want to make (materials, time management, project scope are all important to keep in mind at this stage)</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>WEEK 6-9</h3>
		<p>Production, production, production. Working with milestones and feedback. The goal here is to realize that any one project will never make or break who you are as an artist, so go fast and free into it. We’ll discuss various production approaches from around the globe at this stage.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>WEEK 10</h3>
		<p>Museum visit or production week.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>WEEK 11</h3>
		<p>Final stretch. Review of completed materials. Introduction to the post production workflow.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>WEEK 12</h3>
		<p>You’ll hand me all your materials during the week, I will scan them in and clean them up in my studio. We’ll discuss methods, tips and tricks (which will be available as a document you can keep and grow from) that can best prepared your drawings into legible and well-reproduced files. And then send the files to a printer. <br> As the last week comes to a close we’ll place your order with the printer and within a week or two you should be able to show everyone a fully finished, completely your own, easy to reorder, comic book! More than likely I’ll be your first customer!</p>
		
			<br>
		<h2>Okay, But What If I Don't Finish The Book In Time?</h2>
			<br>
		<p>As unlikely as this is, because of how the course is shaped, we’ll still take the last week to review what you’ve been able to make, and we’ll still go through all the steps necessary to scan and clean your artwork, as well as how to set up your file to be printed. And when you’re done we’ll check in together to make sure everything is just right and the process of printing goes smoothly! </p>
		<p>The point is to get something finished, so all of the documentation and tips and tricks are available for you at the end of the course regardless of whether or not you’ve finished in time. </p>
		<p>There is nothing wrong with needing more time, just as there’s nothing wrong with setting realistic expectations and realizing we need to reassess them later down the road. Everyone does this, and anyone who’s ever done anything has been there :-)</p>
