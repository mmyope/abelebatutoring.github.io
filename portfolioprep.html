		<h1>Portfolio Prep: <br>Foundation to a Succesful Submission</h1>
	</header>	
	
	<main>
		
		<h3>For Sophomore, Juniors, and Seniors.<br>A 12 weeks class.</h3>
			<br>
		<h2>What Is Portfolio Prep?</h2>
			<br>
		<p>Well, generally speaking, portfolio prep is process by which we take many complete and varied works and through editing, critique, and mock-reviews make them fit together into something that best represents the artist! </p>
		<p>On the surface it can feel daunting or even abstract for students to begin this process. So often young artists are so focused on making that they don’t take the time to ask why they’re making. Portfolio prep is there to help mend that. </p>
		
			<br>
		<h2>How I Interpret Portfolio Prep?</h2>
			<br>
		<p>The through line of any successful portfolio is the awareness that professors and schools look at hundreds of portfolios every year, and have seen the same kind of work over and over. That’s not a bad thing, in fact that’s part of the process. But what these professors and schools are looking FOR is a student who has the ability to take their own approach to this work and builds from it a cohesive whole. Hence a portfolio.</p>
		<p>While there is nothing wrong with including your most well-rendered observational studies, or your most up-to-date paintings and prints - not presenting them as a thought out whole is a huge disservice to your work and hinders your chances to be noticed and appreciated for all you’ve put into it. Applying can be made easier, and we can become more confident of sharing this personal work, once we have defined our intentions!</p>
		
			<br>
		<h2>So What Do I Mean?</h2>
			<br>
		<p>It is incredibly important to understand why a piece is placed inside a portfolio. Too often portfolios submitted to art schools lack a sense of purpose, and while they most commonly put together the best and proudest efforts they rarely complete the loop and communicate anything from these efforts. </p>
		<p>Obviously, as you can maybe guess, this means that your portfolio is actually only a part of your submission (alongside your essay answers, sketchbook submissions, and any possible prompts schools might ask you submit for their own programs). </p>
		<p>My class consists of weekly meetings for a semester (12 weeks total) to help us get you to the finish line. By carefully planning out the application process we can free up precious space to perfect your portfolio. So while a majority of this class is focused on the portfolio component of any art school application, a not-insignificant portion is dedicated to proofreading and editing essays, and to brainstorm any prompts art schools may ask for (RISD and Cooper Union come to mind as being programs that make such demands). </p>
		<p>I’m happy to meet with any prospective student of mine to better fine-tune this path forward.</p>	
		
			<br>
		<h2>But, What If You Are A Sophomore Or A Junior,<br>and essays what? prompts who?</h2>
			<br>
		<p>Clearly, so far, this has felt very Senior-Centric. Well - don’t fret. There’s plenty of room for you too! In fact, if you are a Sophomore or a Junior and are interested in this class, then the format changes slightly to better meet your needs. </p>
		<p>Instead of focusing on editing and refining, the portfolio prep class becomes a much more exploratory opportunity to strengthen your foundations and build towards a plethora of well balanced work. Work that can later become the basis for a complete and beautiful portfolio. </p>
		<p>Switching focus away from critique to open discussion of your work and what you want to make, all the while finding the resources to get there, becomes the crux of this class.</p>
		
			<br>
		<h2>A Word To Seniors (mostly),<br> and parents/guardians of Seniors</h2>
			<br>
		<p>The first meeting concludes with a conversation between all of us to help us be on the same foot with regards to the reality of art school, its benefits, its challenges, and the way it works. Meeting together will help you (the applicant) and you (the applicant’s support system) see eye to eye on just what to expect from these programs, and why going to art school is so much more than a degree, and not just an opportunity to make work for four years. </p>
		<p>In addition, and this is very important, I will bring up this idea of the “gap year”, in an effort to promote the wellness and wellbeing of any student. I believe that even putting a gap year on the table can radically change and better your chances to appreciate all the wonderful aspects of any art school program without the unfortunate disorientation that can take place by attending one. We’ll talk, you’ll see!</p>
